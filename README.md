# weather-updater

It is a *desktop GUI application* coded in ***Python*** using the module ***python-tkinter***. 

## Working
This application is able to *fetch and show the weather updates of a particular location based on it's location zip code* entered, by *calling an API endpoint provided by accuWeather* [visit the site here](www.accuweather.com).

This application can be able to *connect to a **SQLite** database*, thus we can *store the weather records in the database*. We can also *fetch the stored record*, *delete an existing record*, but can't modify the record manually as the operation should not be allowed in this case.
